Ad Text 2Pac believed in Fight Tupac Shakur was indeed not just one of the greatest rappers of all time but a worldly icon whose status in hip-hop culture can never be replaced. His revolutionary knowledge mixed with street experience made him powerful unstoppable force that spoke to the hearts of millions of people. His songs touch on a number of engaging topics, including religion, women, oppression, etc. 2Pac was a humanitarian, who stood up for those who couldn't stand up for themselves. He believed in Fight and Speaking the Truth. Nowadays a lot of singers, both black and white use their music to sell records, just for making money. American society at all levels became too corruptive, starting from our government and ending with ordinary citizens. On the contrary Tupac did his music to influence the world. That's why he spoke to issues of poverty, oppression and racism. Today young African-Americans have fallen under bad influence of money, drugs and so on. Yeah, it is all started from the government's attitude towards Blacks. But let's remember Tupac and his ability to question the social order. Changes, one of his popular songs, asks everyone to change their lifestyles for better society. He always asked people to share with each other and to learn to love each other.
